## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript



### What I learned

I learned about classList.toggle. I used it with collapsable mobile menu. It basically allows you to add or remove a specified class from an element's class list.

```js
menuOpen.addEventListener('click',() => {
  rightBar.classList.toggle('hidden');
})
```


### Continued development

I'm trying to master the fundamentals of js and continue to improve my css, responsive design skills. I decided to do some research about css animations and improve my design skills. I will choose that i can try some animations/transitions.
